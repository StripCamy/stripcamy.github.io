<li>c) Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the European Union and the US.</li>

We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>Where we no longer need to process your personal data for purposes set out in this privacy policy, we will delete your personal data from our systems.

<p>Subject to local law, you have certain rights regarding the personal data we collect, use or disclose and that is related to you. We want to make sure you are aware of your rights in relation to the personal data we process about you. We have described those rights and the circumstances in which they apply further below.
Right to Access: This enables you to get access or receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p>Right to Data Rectification and Correction: If you believe that any of the information that we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you have a right to request that we correct the inaccurate personal information.</p>

<ul>

<li>b) we have requested your permission to process your personal information and you wish to withdraw your consent; or</li>
<li>c) we are not using your information in a lawful manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right to object: You have the right to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. If you exercise your right to object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedom or for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal claims.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This also includes profiling in as much as it is related to direct marketing.</p>
<p>If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, then we shall stop the processing of your personal data for such purposes.</p>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, we may need to restrict or cease processing your personal data altogether or, where requested, delete your personal data. Please note that if you object us processing your personal data, we may have to suspend the services we provide to you.</p>
<p>Right to Restriction of Processing: You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data if:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) it is not accurate; or</li>
<li>b) it has been used unlawfully but you do not want us to delete it; or</li>
<li>c) it is not relevant any more, but you want us to keep it for use in possible legal claims; or</li>

</ul>
<p>Please note that if you request us to restrict processing of your personal data, we may have to suspend the services we provide to you.</p>
<p>Right to data portability: Where we have requested your permission to process your personal data or you have provided us with information for the purposes of entering into a contract with us, you have the right to receive the personal data you provided to us in a portable format. You may also request us to provide it directly to a third party, if technically feasible. We are not responsible for any such third party’s use of your account information, which will be governed by their agreement with you and any privacy statement they provided to you.</p>
<p>If we ask for your consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that in case of a withdrawal of your consent you may no longer be able to use several functionalities of our Website and our services.</p>
<p>Please note that some requests to delete certain personal data will require the deletion of your account as a Member and/or Model and/or Studio Operator as the provision of Member and/or Model and/or Studio Operator accounts is inextricably linked to the use of certain personal data (e.g. your email address).
